<p id="question"><br><em>Start out by telling me a little bit about what Better Together LLC is.</em></br>

<br>My team - Emily Gipple, Kate Yeskey (both Kellogg students), and Myself - designed a Home sharing platform to enable seniors to stay in their homes as the age. Here is my elevator speech: It is a home sharing platform that enables seniors to ‘age in place’ by matching them with compatible and responsible young adults that rent spare bedrooms in the seniors’ home at discounted rental rates in exchange for help maintaining the home.</br>

<br><em>How did you work with the Farley Center to help grow your business?</em></br>

<br>We applied to the Farley Center’s summer acceleration program in order to get grant money. The program set us up with coaches and mentors who helped us to pivot or get over obstacles when we ran into them (i.e. connections with relevant sources, creating a lean startup strategy, etc.). It’s also really helpful to be connected to an entrepreneurship community when trying to start a business, which is what the Farley Center is at Northwestern.</br>

<br><em><strong>What was the best part about working with the Farley Center?</strong></em></br>

<br>Farley seems to be doing a really good job of bringing together all parts of NU (including undergrads) because Kellogg seems to close off itself from parts of the NU community…. Especially undergrads. The groups that were involved this summer came from all over Northwestern. Some of the teams started in these student groups (i.e. there was one group that started at ISBE) but most of them were from all parts of the university. Again, it goes back to this community and the synergies that go with it.</br>

<br><em>So what are the next steps for Better Together?</em></br>

<br>Our plan now is to restructure our team. We gained a lot of insight this past summer, both from the Farley Center and some of our advisees from Kellogg. Our CEO, Emily Gipple, will probably be looking for talent to fill in some of the gaps. Places like the Farley Center might help as a place to find talented students that have a passion for entrepreneurship. We’re growing and growing each day so we need to keep adding resources and we’re lucky enough to have a lot of them right here on campus.</br>

                    <p> Northwestern Student Holdings is a student-run holdings company that creates, runs and develops start-up businesses to serve the Northwestern and Evanston communities. Here are two Q&A's with members of the organization that highlight their entrepreneurial experiences with the student group. </p>

<p id="question"><br><em>Why did you decide to join NSH?</em> </br>

<br> I decided to join NSH because I wanted to be involved in the start-up culture at Northwestern, and thought that NSH would be a good way to follow my passion for entrepreneurship. I was also interested in NSH because the prospect of running a business during college was extremely enticing, and thought that it would expose me to running a small business. </br>

<br> <em>How do you think what you've learned as a part of the organization will help you in jobs and in life?</em></br>

<br>This organization has helped me to deal with both a start-up culture and a corporate culture, which will be helpful in the long run. I say start-up culture because, well, we are running a small business and have to make decisions quickly and with little available information. I say corporate culture, because NSH still has a hierarchical structure and so we still have to answer to our superiors (the Board, which is composed of faculty members and Chicago entrepreneurs). I also had to deal with an extremely fast-paced environment during my time at Wildcat Express Delivery, and this will help me in the future because it taught me how to handle stress and make quick decisions without the fear that I'd be making the wrong decision. </br>

<br><em>What was the most rewarding part of your experience?</em></br>

<br>I think the most rewarding part of my experience is the people I've met. The NSH network is a great network to have, as everyone is interested in transforming an idea into a commercial product or service. Additionally, this experience has taught me how to handle stress like no other organization at Northwestern. </br>

<p><br><em>How do you think NSH embodies an entrepreneurial spirit?</em></br>

<br> NSH is all about entrepreneurship. Students are forced to run real companies on a daily basis. We're thrown into real-life start-up scenarios. We're forced to make the most of our limited resources and are encouraged to constantly experiment. All accepted students definitely have some sort of passion or interest in entrepreneurship. Most notably, I think our annual Growth Initiative where all new members participate in researching/designing/writing new business plans is extremely educational. We also benefit from entrepreneurial speakers throughout the year. </br>

<br><em>Are you aware of any comparable groups on campus and how do you think they compare?</em></br>

<br> Honestly, not really. There are certainly other student-run companies on campus, but none are under a portfolio or group like NSH. EPIC is probably the closest undergrad student group as they're all about entrepreneurship and they empower student-run companies, but they don't directly house or run any on a day-to-day basis. </br> 

<br><em>How do you think what you've learned as a part of the organization will help you in jobs and in life?</em></br> 

<br> I've gotten applicable marketing and leadership experiences. From learning how to send mass-newsletter emails, to designing loyalty and referral programs, I've definitely picked up helpful specific skills. In fact, I have talked about my roles within Wildcat Express Delivery in many internship interviews these past couple of years. More generally, leading a team of 20+ employees and being forced to think creatively about how to grow/expand an organization was valuable. However, I think the most useful skill I picked up was the ability to deal with and overcome failures and mistakes by problem solving in the heat of the moment. </br> </p>
